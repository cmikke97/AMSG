# AMSG
Automatic Malware Signature Generation Tool.

# Description

# Requirements

The tool exploits <a href='https://mlflow.org/' title='mlflow'>mlflow</a> open source platform ot package the code in a reusable and reproducible way, to manage the running environment and log results.
Moreover, the project environment is based on a <a href='https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/' title='Conda'>Conda</a> environment.

Therefore, to run this code, it is necessary to have installed both <a href='https://mlflow.org/' title='mlflow'>mlflow</a> and <a href='https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/' title='Conda'>Conda</a>:
- To install <a href='https://mlflow.org/' title='mlflow'>mlflow</a> you can use: `pip install -q mlflow`.
- To install <a href='https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/' title='Conda'>Conda</a>, please refer to https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual or https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Further necessary packages will be downloaded automatically.
